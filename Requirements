1. Python Environment
Python 3.x: Ensure Python 3.6 or higher is installed on your system.
Download Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Dataset Files
Download the following dataset files and place them in the project directory:

tmdb_5000_movies.csv: 
Contains movie details like title, overview, genres, and keywords.

tmdb_5000_credits.csv: 
Contains cast and crew details for the movies.

You can download the dataset from:
Kaggle TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

3. Python Libraries
Install the required Python libraries using pip. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk streamlit

Libraries and Their Purpose:
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For vectorization (CountVectorizer) and similarity calculation (cosine_similarity).
NLTK: For text processing (stemming using PorterStemmer).
Streamlit: For building and running the web interface.

4. NLTK Data
The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) requires additional data for stemming. Run the following commands in a Python shell or script to download the necessary data:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

5. Text Editor or IDE
Use a text editor or IDE to view and edit the code. Some popular options:
VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
Jupyter Notebook: For experimenting with the code (movie.ipynb).

6. Web Browser
A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to interact with the Streamlit app.

7.Summary of Commands:
Install Python and Pip.

Download the dataset files (tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv).

Install dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk streamlit

Download NLTK data:
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
